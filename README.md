# Welcome to my project on the History of the Ryder Cup! 
The reason I chose this project is because I really wanted to showcase the history of the Ryder Cup and all of its glory. The Ryder Cup being in County Limerick, Ireland in 2027 also influenced my decision as it's pretty topcial in the golf world right now. So why not have a look at some history of the event and even register for some tickets? 

The project is aimed mainly at golfers.
